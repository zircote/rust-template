# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the `rust_template` project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

We use the [MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format for our ADRs.

Each ADR file should:
- Be named `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` where `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequential number
- Include the following sections:
  - Title
  - Status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)
  - Context
  - Decision
  - Consequences

## Workflow

### Proposing a New ADR

1. Create a new ADR file in `docs/adr/` with the next sequential number
2. Set status to "proposed"
3. Fill in the context, decision, and consequences sections
4. Submit a pull request

### Accepting an ADR

1. After discussion and approval, change status to "accepted"
2. Merge the pull request

### Superseding an ADR

1. Create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
2. Update the old ADR's status to "superseded" and link to the new ADR
3. Set the new ADR's status to "accepted"

### Deprecating an ADR

If a decision is no longer relevant but hasn't been superseded:
1. Change status to "deprecated"
2. Add a note explaining why it's deprecated

## Viewing ADRs

ADRs are automatically validated and compiled into an HTML viewer on every push to main:

- **Validation**: `.github/workflows/adr-validation.yml` validates ADR format
- **HTML Viewer**: `.github/workflows/adr-viewer.yml` generates browsable HTML documentation

The HTML viewer is uploaded as a build artifact and can be downloaded from the Actions tab.
